# Bucket and files

This is the home page for your addon buckets and domain configuration

### List all the buckets

All the images that are displayed on this documentation are stored on a bucket.

<div className="image-container">
<img data-zoom="75" alt="Buckets list" className="image" src="https://www.bucketws.com/images/file/7bb3c75762736042cc1f80b251085713.png" />
</div>

### Review buckets created by API calls

The next is an screenshot of the buckets for the app https://video.listws.com/.
The buckets were created private by API calls to store all the files for a video project.
All the files involved on a video creation are **private**


### List all the files inside a bucket

You can see the bucket's files and its details.

- The file owner
- File sizes
- Minimap links
- File tags


### Create files with tags

You can easily use a bucket manually or with the API, upload files with tags using the Dashboard UI
